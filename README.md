### A description of the project
This needs and offers market is a place where the community can connect and exchange resources that already exist. 

### Overall problem domain
The individuals in this community are full resources. Often the resources aren't accessed because other community members are not aware or are not connected.

### How the project solves those problems
This market makes the needs and resources known! Whether the need is 1 month of housing, free laundry detergent, or a tour of Pike Place, this market allows individuls to get that need off of their checklist. Bonus, this market is great for locals as well as visitors.
