### A description of the project
This needs and offers market is a place where the community can connect and exchange resources that already exist. 

Visitors can go to the Enter Need page, submit a sticky note, and make their needs known. Each need will be posted to the Need Listings page, along with the other submitted needs for all community members to view. Submitting a need includes the visiting entering a name, best contact email, and a short description of the need.

This Market allows for visitors to also respond to submitted needs. Visitors can drag and drop each sticky note that they can fulfill into the summary section or the Need Listings page. At the end, the visitor will be able to send a separate email to each person who submitted a need, notifying those people of an offer to meet their need. 

### Overall problem domain
The individuals in each community are full of resources. Often the resources aren't accessed because other community members are not aware of the need or are not connected. The individuals go on with their needs unmet or spend unnecessary effort looking outside of the community for alternate solutions. 

### How the project solves those problems
This market makes the needs and resources known. Whether the need is a 3-night stay near Downtown, fragrance-free laundry detergent, or a tour of Seattle Center, this market allows individuls to connect and remove that need off of their checklist. This market is beneficial for locals as well as visitors.
